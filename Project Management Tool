Task -3
 Project management tool 

create a project management tool with a social media-style structure, you can develop an application that includes the following features and components. I'll outline the steps for planning, designing, and developing this tool.

Step 1: Define Requirements and Features

1. User Management:

Sign up and Login (using email, social media, etc.)

User profiles with bio, avatar, role, and skill tags.

Network of contacts (similar to friends or followers).



2. Project and Task Management:

Create, edit, and delete projects.

Create, assign, and prioritize tasks within projects.

Categorize tasks with tags or labels (e.g., "Urgent", "Backlog").

Set deadlines and dependencies between tasks.



3. Group Collaboration:

Create and join group projects.

Project owners can assign or invite members to join specific projects.

Group chat for discussing project-related matters.

Shared resources/documents within project groups.



4. Communication and Social Features:

Comment on tasks, projects, or posts.

Like and share updates within the project.

Activity feed for all user and project activities.

Notifications for updates, comments, or task completions.



5. Progress Tracking and Reporting:

Gantt charts for visual project timelines.

Task completion percentage and workload view.

Reporting on productivity and project status.



6. Integration and File Sharing:

Integration with third-party tools (Google Drive, Slack, etc.).

File sharing and version control within project discussions or tasks.




Step 2: Architecture and Technology Stack

1. Frontend:

Framework: React, Angular, or Vue.js

UI Library: Material UI, Bootstrap, or Tailwind CSS

State Management: Redux (for React), Vuex (for Vue)



2. Backend:

Framework: Node.js (Express), Python (Django), Ruby on Rails

Database: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB)

Authentication: JWT or OAuth 2.0



3. Communication and Collaboration Tools:

Real-time Updates: WebSocket or Pusher

Push Notifications: Firebase or OneSignal



4. Deployment and DevOps:

Cloud Provider: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure

Containerization: Docker

CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions




Step 3: Application Architecture

User Interface Layer: Provides interaction with users, includes pages for login, profile management, project dashboard, task details, and group chat.

API Gateway: Routes all client requests and applies middleware for authentication and rate limiting.

Service Layer:

User Service: Handles user profiles, authentication, and social interactions (friends, comments, etc.).

Project Service: Manages project creation, updates, and task management.

Notification Service: Sends notifications and manages notification preferences.

Chat Service: Supports group chat and task-specific comments.


Database Layer: Stores user data, project details, task information, comments, etc. Consider using a relational database like PostgreSQL to handle structured data and relationships.


Step 4: Feature Implementation

1. Create User Profiles:

Allow users to set up profiles with basic info.

Implement features like friend requests or follow.



2. Project Creation and Management:

Enable users to create projects, define tasks, and assign members.

Use Kanban boards for task management or Gantt charts for project timelines.



3. Task Assignments and Comments:

Add options to comment on specific tasks and tag team members.

Assign tasks with deadlines and priorities.



4. Social Feed for Updates:

Include a social feed where users can post updates, share project milestones, or request feedback.



5. Real-time Collaboration:

Add WebSocket or similar real-time communication support for live updates.

Implement collaborative editing for shared resources.




Step 5: UI/UX Design

1. Create wireframes for all main screens, including:

Login/Registration

User Profile

Project Dashboard

Task Details

Activity Feed

Group Chat



2. Use tools like Figma or Sketch for UI design, ensuring a modern and intuitive look and feel.



Step 6: Development and Testing

1. Development:

Build the frontend using the selected framework.

Develop backend APIs for user and project management.

Set up database schema for projects, tasks, comments, and user profiles.



2. Testing:

Write unit tests for components and services.

Perform integration testing for complete flows.

Conduct user testing to get feedback on usability.




Step 7: Deployment and Maintenance

1. Deploy the application using a cloud provider like AWS or Google Cloud.


2. Set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.


3. Monitor application performance and user feedback.


4. Plan for iterative updates and new feature additions based on user requirements.



This structure and approach should help you create a robust project management tool that incorporates social networking features for better collaboration and communication among users.
